<h1>About Me</h1>

<div class="about-content">
    <div class="about-text">
        <p>I'm a Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) student at the Kelley School of Business, where I blend research, analytics, and systems thinking to solve complex problems and create meaningful connections. I'm driven by curiosity and collaboration, with a belief that technology should be as human as it is innovative.</p>

        <p>My professional interests center on using technology to enable smarter, more adaptive organizations. Whether through systems analysis, technology consulting, or data-driven strategy, I love bridging the gap between people and tech to make ideas tangible and impactful.</p>

        <p>Outside of academics and work, I'm big on balance — I love to lift, run, and spend time outdoors to clear my head. I'm also a fan of horror and indie films (the weirder, the better), and I never miss a chance to travel. Cusco has been my favorite destination so far, and I'm convinced New Orleans has the best food on the planet.</p>

        <p>I'm always looking for new challenges and forward-thinking environments where I can help build solutions that make a real difference — and enjoy the journey along the way.</p>
